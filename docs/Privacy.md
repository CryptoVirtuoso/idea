Additional resources are available from WAX affiliated companies and others, including those listed at https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/wax.

We do not control your relationships with third parties, including our partners and any third party websites or applications to which we or others provide links.  Please check their platforms, websites and applications for information on how they handle your personal information.



Your Data on the Blockchain

In order for the WAX blockchain to work in the secure and transparent manner as intended, it is essential that there be a publicly accessible record of the history of all sales, trades and transfers of a digital item.  This means that certain data, such as your anonymized WAX blockchain account name, cannot be removed once it is part of the permanent record.  This is true for all blockchains, not just WAX.  That’s how blockchains work.  However, if you delete, transfer or close all of your WAX accounts, then your anonymized account name should no longer be publicly associated with you, unless you identify it in any of your own posts or communications with others.

 

Securing your WAX Accounts 

The WAX blockchain was built to be secure, but any security system is only as strong as its weakest link.  Please use the strongest available security options for all of your WAX accounts and for any other accounts, including social media accounts if you may use them to sign up for,  or sign in to, a WAX account or a third party website or service.  This often means using two-factor authentication.  However, just as new threats to security evolve, so do new defenses.  We recommend that you frequently check to see the latest and greatest security options available to you -- and use them.  

 

Scope of this Policy 

This Privacy Policy describes the processing of information provided or collected on the sites and applications where it is posted, in addition to any other privacy notices on such sites or applications.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, your use of any WAX product or service signifies your understanding and acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy, in addition to any posted Terms of Service.

Cookies 

We also collect information from website visitors using “cookies.” We use cookies to transact with you, personalize your experience, analyze usage patterns, and otherwise improve our websites, products and services.

Our cookies include:

Strictly Necessary Cookies are necessary to provide you with products and services. If you refuse them, you may not be able to access such products and services or certain features or functionality may be limited.

Performance Cookies help us enhance the performance and functionality of our websites, products and service, but are not necessary for your use. Still, certain functions or features may become unavailable if you refuse them.

Functional Cookies collect information that is used to help us understand the use of our websites, products and services, the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, or to help us customize our websites to enhance your experience.

Targeting Cookies record your visit to our websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed, so we can recognize you as a prior visitor and track your activity on our websites and others you visit. Certain cookies remain on your device for us to use during a next visit to our websites (“persistent” cookies). In contrast to these “persistent” cookies, some cookies (“session cookies”) are deleted when your browsing session has ended.

Where permitted by applicable law, we may also allow third parties to use cookies on our websites to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites you visit. This information is used to provide advertising tailored to your interests on websites you visit, also known as interest based advertising, and to analyze the effectiveness of such advertising.

You may restrict, block or delete the cookies from our websites at any time by changing the configuration of your browser. You can find out how to do this, and find more information on cookies, at https://www.allaboutcookies.org/. In addition, while each browser has different settings and configurations, cookies settings can typically be adjusted in the "Preferences" or "Tools" menu. Your browser’s "Help" menu may provide additional information.

There are “do not track” or similar browser choices available to internet users with respect to online web activity.  However, given the present lack of consensus of what constitutes an informed election, appropriate trigger or breadth of scope of such choice, our websites generally will not operate any differently when a “do not track” signal is received.

We may collect information using analytics tools, including when you visit our sites and applications or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms.

We may acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provide, or we collected automatically.

Your Controls and Choices

WAX affiliates, our partners and other third parties may provide you with the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use and sharing of your information. In accordance with applicable law, your controls and choices may include:

Correcting, updating, and deleting your registration account. However, in order for the WAX platform to function correctly, all transactions made by you or person(s) authorized by you on your account will permanently remain tied to the unique (anonymized) identification number associated with your WAX wallet. This information is stored within the blockchain and cannot be altered or deleted;

Choosing or changing your choices for subscriptions, newsletters, and alerts;

Choosing whether to receive from us offers and promotions for our products and services, or products and services that we think may be of interest to you;

Choosing whether we share your personal information with other companies so they can send you offers and promotions about their products and services;

Controlling targeted advertising from many ad networks and partners, data exchanges, and marketing analytics and digital advertising and marketing services providers;

Choosing to control targeted advertising you receive within applications by using the settings and choices made available to you through your device(s), for example, by re-setting your device’s advertising identifier and/or opting out of interest based ads;

You may also ask us for the personal information we possess about you, so that you can determine if it is inaccurate or if you want it deleted, provided we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. However, we may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by applicable law.



If you do not allow us to collect personal information, we may not be able to deliver certain experiences, products, and services to you, and we may not be able to take account of your interests and preferences.



Data Security, Integrity, and Retention

The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us. We maintain a variety of security measures, including physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that are designed to protect guest information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. We regularly review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that, despite our efforts, no system can be completely secure. We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.
